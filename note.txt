react 

why react react is easy to learn 
faster to build 
SEO friendlines 
Efficent Code Reuse facility 
Vast communtiy of devlopers 

installation 
   node js 
   npm create @vite latest app name

floder structure 
   tribepratice 
    node modules 
    index.html =>imp
    src folder 
     app.css
     app.js
     index.css
     index.jsx

how the file was rendering ?

inbasic react project we have to the main file index.html in that we have the root 
so the root it will be contain nothing

in index.js 
we should import the reactdom which was on virtualdom the react dom imported 
and we should locally declared thee root 
so we should bring that rood id and declare to the render 


createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
)
so the create rot is the one of the methd so we taking id from that and render the code

wrapping elemets without wrapping what will happens ?

the react contains the fragment 
and have the div ,[],<></>
div wil bn use but it is not good programming praticce
and we have the [ ] after every elemnt we should give the comma in html code 
<> </> the momst commonly used thi k in the react jsx is the fragment it will not be burden 


declaration of variable 
in the jsx code we cant write the any funtions only we can write at out of the function 

variable
im declaring here the varibale var x = "anas"
root.render(
 <>
  <App/>
  {x}
 </>

)
without expression we cant render this  we can use the 
so the expression will be render the code as js 
{50+50} = > example





exporting function, arrays ,varibles and 


useSTATE IS one function where we can set the state intial and update the cureent state




Map function
      map function have mainly to the key and index
searching
 includes 
 filter -searching
 
 for the searching purpose we should use the filter and includes
